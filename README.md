## 1. My Role in the Project
In the project ***Dead Battery***, My I have the following roles:
1. Game mechanism designer: I design part of the game mechanic: such as the player should be able to restore part of their health when they melee.
2. Programmer: I took part in making Enemy zombies AI.

## 2. What I learned
1. I learned how to use C++ to program a character and it's controller in Unreal Engine.
2. I learned how to use blueprint to connect game objects and code.
3. I learned how to use blueprint to adjust properties of objects in Unreal Engine.
4. Overall I learn how a game object connect to each other and how does an engine work properly.

## 3. Challenges:
During the develop phase I did meet some challenge that stop me from developing. For most of the problem I choose ask my friend and YouTube to solve the problem. For example, when I try to make the auto path finding AI. I ask one of the friend in another team. And he recommended me a YouTube video which quickly help me solve the problem.

One video I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHvriqpc3qE

## 4. Version Control:
In my team, we used GitHub LFS to manage our files and versions. At the beginning of the team, I created the GitHub Repository and started to manage it. Since I have some experience with GitHub before, it if not that hard to keep the github clear. However, I did meet some problem when trying to connect github with Unreal. The TA Yihong Xu help me with that and we later keep using GitHub as our version control.
